The UNIX shell uses process APIs such as fork(), wait(), and exec(). For instance when calling a command in the shell (`echo "hello world"`), the shell finds the command executable within the file system, calls the fork() OS call which will create a child process, calls exec() to execute the command, then calls wait() in the parent process to wait for the child to finish executing the command. When the child completes, the shell returns from wait() to allow another command to be executed.
